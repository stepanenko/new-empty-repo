All of good ideas from the world of programming language design combine
in a unique way to make Rust a language that truly makes you think about writing
code from a novel perspective. It does not matter how much experience you have,
learning Rust will forever change the way you write code for the better.

There is no best programming language. Almost every task has a variety of languages
which could be the right tool. Every language comes with good parts and bad parts.
Evaluating these trade-offs when faced with a particular problem is an art.
